# LeetCode Problem 2745: [Construct the Longest New String](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-longest-new-string/)

## Description
Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the lengths of three strings, you need to construct the longest string you can following these rules:
- The string should start with a character 'a' and then the rest of the string should consist of characters 'b'.
- The string should not contain any three consecutive characters 'aaa'.
- Return the length of the longest string you can construct, or 0 if it's impossible to construct any string.

## Solution Approach
The solution compares the lengths of the given strings `x`, `y`, and `z`. It determines the length of the longest string that can be constructed based on the following conditions:
- If `x` is equal to `y`, it returns the sum of the lengths of the strings multiplied by 2.
- If `x` is greater than `y`, it returns the sum of `y`, `y`, `z`, and `1`, multiplied by 2.
- If `y` is greater than `x`, it returns the sum of `x`, `x`, `z`, and `1`, multiplied by 2.

## Java Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestString(int x, int y, int z) {
        if(x == y)
            return (x + y + z) * 2;
        else if(x > y)
            return (y + y + z + 1) * 2;
        else
            return (x + x + z + 1) * 2;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(1). The solution performs a constant number of operations irrespective of the input values.
- Space Complexity: O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of space.

## Code Explanation
1. The `longestString` method takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` representing the lengths of three strings.
2. It compares the lengths of `x` and `y` and determines the longest string that can be constructed based on the conditions mentioned above.
3. Depending on the comparison result, it calculates the length of the longest string using the given formulae.
4. Finally, it returns the length of the longest string that can be constructed following the given rules.

This algorithm efficiently calculates the length of the longest string that can be constructed following the specified rules.
