# LeetCode Problem 669: [Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Description
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and integers low and high, trim the BST such that all the values of the resulting tree fall within the range [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be assumed that the input is a valid BST.

## Solution Approach
The solution employs a recursive approach to traverse the BST. At each node, it checks if the node's value is within the given range. If not, it recursively trims the left or right subtree accordingly. The process continues until all nodes are trimmed to fit within the specified range.

## Java Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if(root == null)
            return root;
        if(root.val < low)
            return trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        if(root.val > high)
            return trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The algorithm visits each node once.
- Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. The space used by the recursion stack is proportional to the height of the tree.

## Code Explanation
1. The `trimBST` method takes the root of the BST and the range [low, high] as input.
2. If the root is null, it returns null.
3. If the value of the root is less than `low`, it recursively calls `trimBST` on its right subtree.
4. If the value of the root is greater than `high`, it recursively calls `trimBST` on its left subtree.
5. Otherwise, it recursively calls `trimBST` on both left and right subtrees.
6. Finally, it returns the modified root after trimming.

This algorithm effectively prunes the tree based on the given range and returns the trimmed tree while preserving the BST properties.
